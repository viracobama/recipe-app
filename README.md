# recipe-app
Welcome to our recipe app.

From the barebones recipe-app, we added two enchanced features.
The first feature we added includes a category section for each recipe. Each recipe can now be assigned breakfast,
lunch, dinner, dessert, and snack. So when selecting a category, only meals of that category should show. 

The second feature added is a search bar. This search bar allows users to search up meals by title or by ingredient. For an example if a fried chicken recipe was added to the the app with the ingredients app in the lunch section, it would show up along with the other lunch recipes added but if it is the only recipe that has raw chicken wings and you search up raw chcken wings, then the fried chicken recipe will be the only recipe to show up in the list.

Also some CSS was added to make it less plain. We went with a simple salmon, white, and grey color scheme. The text boxes, header, and footers reflect these changes.
